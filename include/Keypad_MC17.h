|| @description
|| | Keypad_MC17 provides an interface for using matrix keypads that
|| | are attached with Microchip MCP23017 I2C port expanders. It 
|| | supports multiple keypads, user selectable pins, and user
|| | defined keymaps.
|| | The MCP23017 is somewhat similar to the MCP23016 which is supported
|| | by the earlier library Keypad_MC16. The difference most useful for
|| | use with Keypad is the provision of internal pullup resistors on the
|| | pins used as inputs, eliminating the need to provide 16 external 
|| | resistors. The 23017 also has more comprehensive support for separate
|| | 8-bit ports instead of a single 16-bit port. However, this library
|| | assumes configuration as 16-bit port--IOCON.BANK = 0.
|| #
||
|| @version 2.0 - April 5, 2020
|| | MKRZERO, ESP32 compile error from inheriting TwoWire that was OK with
|| | original ATMEGA boards; possibly because newer processors can have
|| | multiple I2C WireX ports. Consequently, added the ability to specify
|| | an alternate Wire as optional parameter in constructor.
